# Shopping-Trends-Analytics-SQL-Python-Power-BI

Shopping Trends Analytics Project is an end-to-end data analytics pipeline built using SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI.

We started by importing the Shopping Trends dataset into a SQL Server database to ensure secure, structured storage and efficient querying. The database was then connected to Visual Studio Code, where we performed advanced data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical insights using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

After processing and generating meaningful KPIs, the cleaned dataset was exported into an Excel sheet, serving as the single source of truth. Finally, we built a fully interactive Power BI dashboard with DAX measures and visualizations to uncover hidden shopping patterns and provide actionable business insights.

This project demonstrates skills in data engineering, data analysis, business intelligence (BI), and visual storytelling by transforming raw transactional data into clear, data-driven decisions.
